## Status

The game jam ended on January 29th, and this game **won first prize**! The code and assets here are stored for others to see and use for any of their future projects. Please note that since the game jam had such a short timeframe to work on the game, some of the code and design choices are hacky and unfinished, so that a suitable product could be submitted on time!
